Welcome to my humble webpage on the vast internet! I am Martijn, and I use *mrtijn* as my
nickname online.

My (computer-related) interests include information security, cryptography, embedded systems,
free software and Linux server administration.

## Projects

* [Software was a mistake](https://softwarewasamistake.eu): sometimes software is so bad,
that you might think it was a mistake to start with it at all.
* [Summary of _Capital and Ideology_]({{< ref path="projects/kapitaal-en-ideologie.nl.md" lang="nl" >}}):
I wrote a Dutch summary of _Capital and Ideology_ by [Thomas Piketty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Piketty).
